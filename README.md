# Linear Regression Model from Scratch

This project contains an implementation of a Linear Regression model from scratch in Python, as well as an example usage of the model on a random dataset generated using scikit-learn.

## Usage

To use the Linear Regression model, simply import the `LinearRegression` class from the `Linear_regression.py` file in your Python code, create an instance of the class, and call the `fit` method on your training data to train the model. Once the model is trained, you can use the `predict` method to make predictions on new data.

## Example

An example of using the Linear Regression model on a random dataset with multiple features can be found in the `test_model.ipynb` file. This file generates a random dataset using scikit-learn, trains a Linear Regression model using the `LinearRegression` class, and makes predictions on the test set. The predicted values are then compared to the true values to evaluate the performance of the model.
